      <h1>BulSU-SRC GUIDANCE PROGRAM</h1>
      <p>
        The Bulacan State University Guidance and Counseling Services Center San Rafael Campus (GCSC) plays a crucial role in each student's academic success. It provides guidance and counseling services, along with various programs, for individuals, families, and groups who seek help, whether through referral or walk-in. The GCSC understands that each student needs to make informed decisions and adapt to various aspects of their personal and community life. These skills are not innate; they must be developed gradually through education.
      </p>
      <p>
        The GCSC-SRC aims to offer opportunities and learning experiences that help students cultivate these skills. It serves as a vital resource for such opportunities. While the GCSC-SRC acknowledges each student’s democratic right to make choices, it also strives to assist them in making informed and independent decisions in their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        The center integrates students’ self-awareness regarding their strengths, weaknesses, aptitudes, talents, interests, and potential, enhancing their roles within their personal lives and communities. It helps identify the needs and challenges faced by students and uses this information to develop the curriculum and establish school policies and regulations that support the academic mission.
      </p>

      <h2>GUIDANCE SERVICES</h2>

      <h3>INDIVIDUAL INVENTORY</h3>
      <p>
        The GCSC-SRC provides an essential service known as the Individual Inventory Service, which involves filling out students' cumulative records. This is a collaborative process of collecting relevant data and specific information about each student to create an understanding of their personal background. All information gathered during this process will be kept for future reference and treated with strict confidentiality.
      </p>

      <h3>COUNSELING SERVICE</h3>
      <p>
        The Counseling service aims to assist students in navigating the complexities of their emotional and psychological well-being. It provides an opportunity for students to delve deeper into their emotions, values, perceptions, relationships, fears, and life choices, ultimately leading to a greater understanding of themselves and their identity. Through this process, students become more self-aware and gain the tools to become more self-directed individuals, capable of making informed decisions and living a fulfilling life.
      </p>

      <h3>REFERRAL SERVICE</h3>
      <p>
        The GCSC-SRC is committed to promoting open communication with all stakeholders, including students, faculty members, non-academic personnel, and parents. By providing referral services, the center aims to assist individuals who require additional support and guidance. The guidance counselor plays a crucial role in this effort, working closely with those in need to identify potential linkages and partnerships that may be beneficial. Whether it's addressing academic or personal concerns, the GCSC-SRC is dedicated to providing the resources and assistance necessary to help individuals thrive.
      </p>

      <h3>FOLLOW-UP SERVICE</h3>
      <p>
        The Follow-up service is carried out to assess whether an individual is making satisfactory progress in their current situation and whether the opportunities provided are suitable for them. Students who are on probation or have low grades are given individual attention and support. They are guided in identifying the reasons behind their poor academic performance. This service is designed to help them cultivate the right attitude and develop the necessary skills to manage their academic workload effectively.
      </p>

      <h3>TESTING SERVICE</h3>
      <p>
        Testing is a service that appraises a student's ability, achievement, and other characteristics. The data collected from these tests are used to predict future performance, diagnose student problems and learning difficulties, and evaluate instructional methods and programs. Standardized tests are used to assess strengths and weaknesses in the areas of personality, aptitudes, interests, motivation, and job skills. The test results are interpreted by the students to help them gain self-awareness, growth, and development.
      </p>

      <h3>INFORMATION SERVICE</h3>
      <p>
        The GCSC-SRC aims to provide students with a greater knowledge of educational, vocational, and personal-social opportunities so they can make intelligent choices and decisions in an increasingly complex society. The GCSC-SRC either conducts or sponsors symposiums and seminar workshops on topics related to the student's personal mental health concerns. The Center guides students toward career awareness and educational identity through psychological testing and career counseling, dissemination of career information, and job offerings. This procedure helps provide different outlets for personal characteristics and individual needs.
      </p>

      <h3>EXTENSION SERVICE</h3>
      <p>
        GCSC-SRC offers a wide range of services to meet the needs of students, staff, offices, community, civic, school, and religious organizations. These services include providing resources and acting as speakers for seminars, workshops, team-building events, and other similar activities. With their expertise and experience, GCSC-SRC is committed to providing an enriching and engaging learning experience to all those who seek their assistance.
      </p>

      <h3>PROFESSIONAL STAFF DEVELOPMENT</h3>
      <p>
        Counselors and Guidance Professionals play a vital role in guiding individuals to overcome personal and emotional challenges. By engaging in ongoing learning and professional development opportunities, they can enhance their knowledge, skills, and expertise, leading to better outcomes for their clients. This commitment to continuous learning showcases their dedication to providing high-quality care and support.
      </p>

      <h3>RESEARCH AND EVALUATION</h3>
      <p>
        This service is designed and organized to provide substantial and adequate data for the continual development of the GCSC-SRC Guidance Program. GCSC-SRC also assists various departments in measuring the programs and activities it offers. Data available at the GCSC-SRC are utilized for research purposes.
